Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

-Software engineering is the sytematic utilization of egineering principles, methodologies, and tools to design, develop, test, deploy, and maintain software systems.
-Software engineering is important as it helps in the creation of high quality and rliable software application that are used across various industries and day to day activities.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 is a key moment in the history of software engineering as the term "software engineering" was introduced during this conference as software developers sought to establish best practices for the field. This was in  response to the growing software development crisis.
-The rise and mainstreaming of object-oriented programming(1970s-1980s) enabled the development of modular and reusable code thus improving code maintenance and the scaling of software development projects to the users and developers needs.
-The agile manifesto (2001), provided values and principles that could be implement in the software development process. This led to a shift to  development process that llowed for iterative programming, collaboration and teamwork, flexibility, and constant user/consumer engagement throught the process of developing new software.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

1. Requirements analysis: this is the stage where the designer  gathers information on the software development project, scopes the work, so as to develop a software that meets user goals.
2. Design:This involves using the information from the requirements stage and research to plan and create a framework/blueprint for the software. The design phase allows software developers to envision the various elements of the end project such ss architecture, modules, and interfaces
3. Development/implementation: This is the process of writting code as per the project design and specification.
4. Testing: This is the process of esnuring that the developed software works as per the specifictions and requireents
5. Deployment: This is the release if the software to the market where the users can use it in the environments it is designed for in real life.
6. Maintenance: This is the continous support,improvement, and updating after development to ensure that it continues to serve its users as per the requirements.
   
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall methodology
   This is a sequential approach to the software development lifecycle whwereby each phase is completed before proceeding to the next
   phase. This methodology is quite rigid and best fits projects with strictly defined requirements that require very little changes such
   as softwares for highly regulated industries.
2.Agile methodology
  An iterative and adaptable approach that values cooperation and customer feedback. Agile is suitable for projects with changing
  requirements, such as software startups or product development, where user needs may shift over time.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. Software Development: Their role the designing, writing, testing, and maintenance of code to create a functional software.
2. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:Ensures that the program meets quality standards by creating and carrying out test plans, identifying bugs, and confirming patches.
3. Project Manager: oversees the team's work, keeps an eye on the project's development, controls budgets and schedules, and makes sure the project achieves its objectives and satisfies stakeholder expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1.Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):
  Offer a comprehensive workspace with code editors, debugging tools, and version control integration. Examples include Visual Studio
  Code and IntelliJ IDEA.

2.Version Control Systems (VCS):
  Allow developers to monitor changes, collaborate, and roll back to prior versions of the codebase. Examples include Git and Subversion.   VCS is essential for managing code changes, particularly in larger teams or projects.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements and scope creep: The requirements of a project can shift during the development making it difficult to keep   track of development especialy for large projects. A strategy to overcome this problem is the use of the Agile strategy to allow iterative developments that can be tracked. Additonally, agile allows for constant consumer/stakeholder feedback allowing the developers to remain on track with the project deliverables.
2. Technical Debt: This is a situation where the developers take shortcut in the development process creating issues at later stages of the development process. This is often a significant issue for projects with short delivery timelines where design may opt for speed at the expense of quality. The solution to this issue is the regular refactoring of the code to enahnce its quality and reduce bugs. Further, the planning and design phase should allow for adequate time and prioritising on the code-quality.
3. Time management: Balancing the various phases of the software development process is hectic and can often lead to a lack of balance and overload on the developer. This can be aovercomed by the automation of some phases through the use of the CI/CD pipeline.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit Testing: Involves isolating the various functions and components into into isolated units and  testing them individually. This ensures that all the individual parts work as they should.
2.Integration Testing: Involves that several parts that work together and verifying that they work correctly as modules after the integration.
3.System Testing: TThis involves the testing the entire software as a whole system to ensure its stability as well as how well it meets the design specifications.
4.Acceptance Testing: This is testing a software against the user needs and requirements to ensure it serves their needs upon deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

-Prompt engineering is creating and modifying prompts to assist AI models in producing correct and relevant replies. It is critical for increasing the efficacy and efficiency of interactions with AI models, especially in natural language processing jobs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
1.Vague Prompt: "Tell me about Global warming"
2.Improved Prompt: "Explain the main causes of global warming and their impact on the sea levels over the past 50 years."
